# Contributing to this project

This project is a publicly licensed C# package and will have a public home on
https://www.github.com/tychosoft. This will have an issue tracker where people
can submit public bug reports, and a public git repo. All project documentation
will also be found either in a project wiki or in the project repo.

## CI Integration

Github actions will be used for public ci operations. There are only a few
types of ci actions I may use. One will be to evaluate merge requests, and if
this is broken hopefully whomever submits a merge request can fix it. Others I
may add over time for public things that need to be done for a new tagged
release.

## Documentation

I am striving to make all project documentation viewable either thru each
projects wiki pages or directly in the repo. The wiki will be used for
projects that have graphical images for documentation.

## Issues

The github support ticket system can be used for bug requests, discussion
items, or any other kind of inquiry at all. It's contents are fully public.
