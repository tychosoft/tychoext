# Contributing to this project

This project is publicly licensed C# project and will have a public home on
https://www.github.com/tychosoft. This will an issue tracker where people can
submit public bug reports, and a public git repo. All project documentation
will also be found either in a project wiki or in the projects repo.

## CI Integration

Github actions will be used for public ci operations. There are only a few
types of ci actions I may use. One will be to evaluate merge requests, and if
this is broken hopefully whomever submits a merge request can fix it. Others I
may add over time for public things that need to be done for a new tagged
release.

## Documentation

I am striving to make all project documentation viewable either thru each
projects wiki pages or directly in the repo. The wiki will be used for
projects that have graphical images for documentation.

## Issues

The support ticket system can be used for bug requests, discussion items, or
any kind of inquiry at all. It's contents are fully public. It also is entirely
separate from my own internal development ticketing.
